          <p>I like to think of myself as someone who can find the fun in what I do. Coming from care work, turning the
            average day
            into something to enjoy was always important to help those I was working with to increase their motivation.
            Care work
            also
            gave
            me solid experience in communicating with others, since a lot of the people I was working with were
            non-verbal or
            had
            limited communication, I had to learn to adjust my communication both spoken and not, to become a good
            carer. This
            was
            particularly helpful for me having grown up diagnosed with Autism.</p>
          <br>
          <p> In tech I have been inspired by video games, originally going to university to study games design but
            shifting
            into
            the
            direction of software, since I found the fun in simply making computers do things. However, that games
            design
            experience
            isn’t wasted. Since a lot of games design is focused around making the players' experience as exciting as
            possible, I’m
            constantly conscious of the user experience. In games that would be ensuring that game mechanics were
            accessible
            and
            controls were intuitive, which lines up with software in making apps user friendly and readable.</p>

              fullstack project phase to make me confident and work ready. On this course I developed a keen interest in

            <p>I attended University to study Computer Games Design and Development, giving me a strong understanding of
              the
              theoretical side of Games Design and the skills to design and develop video games within a number of
              different frameworks and engines. While on this course I took part in game jams and completed several
              large scale assignments and projects.</p>

          <p>Currently, I am working on a Phaser game within a React app as part of my final project for Northcoders.
            The
            game is about going out into the world post-lockdown and helping people. It's a game about positivity,
            something that is really needed right now.The links to the hosted React App and Github Repo are below</p>
          <p>This was built as a group project with 3 others. While I had been pair programming for a while this was my
            first experience of developing a fullstack project over a 3 week period. We broke our projects down into
            tasks
            and had sprints to build these features and mechanics out in pairs or solo.</p>

            </div>
            <p>This was my first attempt at a react app and I'm fairly happy with what I made. It makes GET requests to
              the <a href='https://pokeapi.co/'>poke-api</a> then builds a random team of 6 pokemon and shows you their
              types and stats.
              The idea being that a player will catch these pokemon in the game of their choice. Possible additions
              would be a game drop down menu to limit pokemon by game.</p>
