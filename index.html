          <p>I like to think of myself as someone who can find the fun in what I do. Coming from care work, turning the
            average day
            into something to enjoy was always important to help those I was working with up their motivation. Care work
            also
            gave
            me solid experience in communicating with others, since a lot of the people I was working with were
            non-verbal or
            had
            limited communication, I had to learn to adjust my communication both spoken and not, to become a good
            carer. This
            was
            particularly helpful for me having grown up diagnosed with Autism.</p>
          <br>
          <p> In tech I have been inspired by video games, originally going to university to study games design but
            shifting
            in
            the
            direction of software, since I found the fun in simply making computers do things. However, that games
            design
            experience
            isn’t wasted. Since a lot of games design is focused around making the players' experience as exciting as
            possible, I’m
            constantly conscious of the user experience. In games that would be ensuring that game mechanics were
            accessible
            and
            controls were intuitive, which lines up with software in making apps user friendly and readable.</p>

          <p>I have completed a software development bootcamp at Northcoders over the past few months, a 14 week
            intensive
            course
            taught using Javascript split into a fundementals, backend, frontend and finally fullstack project phase to
            make
            me
            confident and work read. On this course I developed a keen inerest in React and Frontend development.</p>

          <p>Attended University to study Computer Games
            Design and Development, giving me strong understanding of the
            theoretical
            side of Games Design and the skills to design and develop video games within a number of different
            frameworks
            and
            engines. While on this course I took part in game jams and completed several large scale assignments and
            projects.</p>

    <p>Currently, I am working on a Phaser game within a React app as part of my final project for Northcoders. The game
      is about going out into the world post lockdown and helping people. It's a game about positivity, something that
      is really needed right now. Find the link to the gitHub here. Should be hosted by 13th of November.</p>
    <p>This was built as a group project with 3 others. While I had been pair programming for awhile this was my first
      experince of developing a fullstack project over a 3 week period. We broke our projects down into tasks and had
      sprints to build these features and mechanics out in pairs or solo.</p>
