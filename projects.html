          <h3>This Website</h3>
          <p>I like to see this website as another example of my ability and willingness to try new things. Before this
            I had maybe
            done 30 minutes of html and css total so it's been an incredibly fun learning experience for me to put
            together this
            website. I'm also a bit of a completionist so having this one place for me to display and track my work over
            the years
            in a format that's appealing, is immensely satisfying.</p>

          <h3>Discord Bot</h3>
          <p>A bot I have been working with some of my free time here and there. It takes a command from the chat logs
            of
            a Discord
            server, prefixed with a * and uses these commands to perform various actions such as joining a chat and
            playing YouTube
            audio, posting gifs and even doing some maths.</p>
